# ðŸ¤– ML Prototype: Predicting Treatment Failure Using AMR Profiles and Clinical Metadata

**Status:** In Development  
**Objective:** To develop a predictive machine learning model that estimates antibiotic treatment failure based on the presence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes and patient-specific clinical metadata.

This prototype integrates microbial genomics with clinical data to model real-world outcomes, offering a foundation for precision-guided treatment strategies and data-driven antimicrobial stewardship.

## ðŸ§ª Workflow Overview

This early-stage pipeline outlines the following steps:

---

### 1. Data Integration

**Description:**  
Combine gene presence/absence data from `amrfinder` with clinical variables such as patient demographics, treatment outcome, and antibiotic used.

**Why it matters:**  
Mirrors real-world clinical decision-making where microbial and host factors intersect to determine outcomes.

**Expected Output:**  
A merged dataset suitable for supervised ML tasks, enabling multi-dimensional analysis of resistance and treatment failure.

---

### 2. Feature Engineering

**Description:**  
- Encode AMR genes as binary variables (`0` = absent, `1` = present)  
- Normalize continuous variables  
- Apply one-hot encoding to categorical clinical features

**Why it matters:**  
Transforms raw data into a structured format while preserving domain-specific meaning.

**Expected Output:**  
A clean feature matrix optimized for model performance and biological interpretability.

### 3. Baseline Modeling

**Description:**  
- Use an 80/20 train-test split  
- Train a **Logistic Regression** model as the initial benchmark  
- Evaluate using metrics: ROC-AUC, F1-score, confusion matrix

**Why it matters:**  
Provides an interpretable and lightweight baseline to assess model feasibility and generalization.

**Expected Output:**  
Baseline performance metrics to inform future model iterations.

### 4. Advanced Modeling: XGBoost

**Description:**  
Train and tune an **XGBoost classifier** to account for potential nonlinear relationships and interaction effects between features.

**Why it matters:**  
XGBoostâ€™s ability to handle sparsity and class imbalance makes it particularly effective for complex biological datasets.

**Expected Output:**  
An optimized, higher-performing model to compare against the baseline.

---

### 5. Model Explainability: SHAP

**Description:**  
Use **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** to quantify feature contributions at the global and individual levels.

**Why it matters:**  
In clinical ML, transparency is key. SHAP allows stakeholders to understand and trust model outputs.

**Expected Output:**  
- SHAP summary plots  
- Top contributing AMR genes and clinical variables  
- Case-level explanations for high-risk predictions

---

### 6. Risk Visualization

**Description:**  
Visualize model outputs through:

- Risk scores for individual patients  
- Feature impact charts  
- Potential dashboard views

**Why it matters:**  
Visual outputs enhance the accessibility of model insights, especially for non-technical stakeholders.

**Expected Output:**  
Visualization assets to support communication, reporting, or dashboard integration.
