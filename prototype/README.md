# ML Prototype: Predicting Treatment Failure in Typhoid

🚧 This section contains early-stage work on building an ML model using AMR gene profiles + clinical metadata.

🛠️ Status: In Progress  
🎯 Goal: Predict treatment failure using Logistic Regression and XGBoost

Planned steps:
- [x] Data loading
- [ ] Feature engineering (binary encoding of AMR genes)
- [ ] Train/test split and baseline model
- [ ] SHAP/interpretability
- [ ] Risk score visualization

This will evolve into a full project deliverable — current focus is on rapid prototyping and model validation.
