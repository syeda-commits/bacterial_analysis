## üß¨ Data Source

This pipeline was tested using paired-end sequencing data of *Salmonella enterica*, obtained from the [NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra).

The raw sequencing data corresponds to an uncharacterized *Salmonella enterica* isolate. The dataset was publicly available through NCBI SRA, and the strain identity was intentionally withheld during the initial analysis to simulate an unbiased, real-world workflow for genome assembly, annotation, and AMR profiling.

All analytical steps‚Äîincluding quality control, sequence assembly, filtering, annotation, and AMR gene detection‚Äîwere performed independently by the researcher.
