## ðŸ§¬ Data Source

This pipeline was tested using paired-end sequencing data of Salmonella enterica from the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA).

The raw sequencing data analyzed in this project corresponds to an uncharacterized strain of Salmonella enterica. The dataset was publicly available through NCBI SRA, but the strain identity was intentionally withheld at the start of the analysis to facilitate hands-on learning in genome assembly and annotation. All steps including identification, assembly, filtering, annotation, and AMR gene detection were performed independently by the researcher.

> The data was used for educational and research purposes only.
